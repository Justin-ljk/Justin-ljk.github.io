<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 background</h3>
<p>Nowadays, as internet became widespread among people, fashion is changing almost every second. 
Under this situation, many teenagers, especially girls, are entangled in the problem of what to wear daily considering weather and their mood.</p>
<h3>1.2 current approach</h3>
<p>Along side of the development of internet, online shopping had became more well-rounded, 
including intelligent cloth recommendation. There are already many programs reccomending clothes for buyers, but none of them can help to determine what to wear under given circumstances. Temporarily, there are no similar products in the market yet.</p>
<h3>1.3 objective </h3>
<p>The purpose of this product is to recommend clothing options to user through virtual assistant. By comparing with big data, it will be able to tell different styles of clothing, and provide valuable suggestions according to local weather, users' mood, and their plans for the day. The clothing data is mianly collected from social medias, tracking messages and photos posted by stars that the user follow.

<h3>2.1 machine learning</h3>
<h4>2.1.1 data</h4>
<h5>format</h5>
<p>the pictures provided in the dataset are in "ubyte" format, so it requires a program to interpret them and turn them into visually pictures of all kinds of clothes
<h5>tags</h5>
<p>the tags of different clothes are also included in the dataset, these tags are written in numbers, so it requires a program to correspond it with the language that we speak like "ankle boots"

<p>the dataset consisted of two different subsets, training and testing, the function of them perfectly matched their names
<h4>2.1.2 artificial intelligence</h4>
<h5>developing</h5>
<p>Import libraries and load the data downloaded
<p>build network model
<h6>define optimizer, training and testing methods</h6>
<p>every time after training, the program will calculate the errors made during training and the artificial intelligence will refine itself according to the optimizer
<h5>testingand training</h5>
<p>call trian and test functions
<p>predict outputs and show pictures
<p>it's expected that the prediction page will be able to not only recommend clothes, but also provide information about where clothes will be found.

<h3>2.2 hardware</h3>
<p>The building fo the hardware of many parts, the most important part is the virtual assistant. The virtual assistant is responsible for the interaction from acquiring specific information to the end of the whole process of recommending. There are also other parts including the microphone to analyse speaking and the computer used to collect data, ect.

<h2>3. Results and Discussion</h2>
<h3>3.1 Results</h3>
<h4>3.1.1 Data Collection</h4>
<p>Through the web crawler, the product will be able to collect (this much) data from (social medias), it can also (whatever function)
<h4>3.1.1 Data analysis</h4>
<p>Using the AI we previously trained, the data collected from the social media will be analysised and sorted into many categories. (actual results) (errors?)
<h4>3.1.1 Recommendation</h4>
<p>During the process of recommendation, the clothing that user already has or from a social media that the user follows will be valued higher than others. (actual results)
<h3>3.2 Comparsion with Expectation</h3>
<p>One thing I have expected but can't be realized yet is the automatic recording of the location of the clothes. This process involves detecing the taking out and putting in of every single cloth, which I hadn't think of an easy way to build yet.

<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
<h3>4.1 Does it reach my ultimate purpose?</h3>
<p>I would ay that this project effectively achieved/didn't achiheve my ultimate purpose. It......through/because...... Compared with my purpose, 
<h3>4.2 Future Possibilities</h3>
<p>Though I'm satisfied with my current product, I believe much future improvements can be made. ......
